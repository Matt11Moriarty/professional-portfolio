# Matthew Moriarty's Professional Portfolio

## Description

This professional portfolio serves as a home page for me (Matthew Moriarty) to share my projects and highlight my skills as a developer.
At time of writing (06/2023), only the resume is up to date. The projects are placeholders for future work that I can replace with legitimate projects in the future!

Creating this portfolio provided me with the oportunity to sharpen my CSS skills and practice using flex-box, and other cool styling techniques.
